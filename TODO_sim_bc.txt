run_sim, webapp basics. some additional code to differentiate between expansions.

scrape from twinstar, cavernoftime seems off by +1 on most stats.
refactor procs, on use effects to avoid boilerplate code, track proc uptime
attack speed %: haste vs. speed multiplier

gcd on stance change?
http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_2.4.0:
Stances: It is no longer possible to accidentally change into a stance you are already in via macros (resulting in a global cooldown and loss of rage).

proc:
x wf
x items (drakefist hammer, Hourglass of the Unraveller)
x enchants

on use:
x drums x2
x haste potion
x heroism
x items (Bloodlust Brooch)

comparisons:
no op + anger management vs. op + no anger management

dw spec, imp exe, weapon mastery, precision, imp ww choice
5/5 dw, 0/2 exe, 2/2 wm, 3/3 prec, 1/2 ww: 1669.52
5/5 dw, 0/2 exe, 2/2 wm, 2/3 prec, 2/2 ww: 1662.15
5/5 dw, 2/2 exe, 2/2 wm, 1/3 prec, 1/2 ww: 1668.26
3/5 dw, 2/2 exe, 2/2 wm, 3/3 prec, 1/2 ww: 1659.03

rampage @ execute phase?
nope, slightly worse: 1669.52 (no rampage, below-average run) vs. 1668.76 DPS (rampage, only one run done)
might be slightly better if not refreshed anymore ~20-25 seconds before the fight ends, but not worth the hassle.

ww: wait for bt

research:
is ww with both hands actually 2 attacks, 2 times damage dealt, 2 times chance to proc stuff etc.?
2.4 patch notes seem to indicate this: "Whirlwind: Critical strikes with the off-hand weapon from this ability can now trigger Flurry and Rampage."

execute weapon set:
trigger gcd, reset swing timer at start of execute phase
procs, on use, socket_stats, enchants of execute set during execute phase

fix seed for fight lengths to minimize fluctuations?

match gear planner / ingame stats:
- fix base stats
- implement wowhead scraper or switch to scrape from gear planner
x correct enchants, consumables
